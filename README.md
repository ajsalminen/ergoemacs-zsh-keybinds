Ergoemacs-zsh-keybinds
==========

Introduction
------------

[Ergoemacs](http://ergoemacs.github.io/ergoemacs-mode/) keyboard shortcuts for [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/).
Also bindings for [zaw](https://github.com/zsh-users/zaw).

Usage
-----

Just source in your .zshrc or put to .oh-my-zsh/custom if using [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
Uncomment bind for history-search-backward if you don't use zaw-history for it like I do.
